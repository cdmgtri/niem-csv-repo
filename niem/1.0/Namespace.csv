It also defines property types and elements according to the conventions required by the Geography Markup Language (GML) specification.

However, it applies to the development of the GML application schemas that must in most cases be developed to effectively use GML in niem IEPs.



Note for schema readers:  The XML/Schema specification does not require processing implementations to transitively import definitions from imported schemas.
